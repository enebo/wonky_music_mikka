This is a version of https://github.com/elisehuard/wonky_music reimagined using Mikka.  The basic music playing is the same but it does things a little differently with regards to message passing and I also changed it so the Conductor interacts with a Band of Instruments.  It should behave the same way as the original.

It is a really fun demo with sound :)
